      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>* applies element to all aspects visible on a page.</li>
        <li>In the preceding statement, a
        <li>link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
        <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.
        </li>
        <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a
          relative path.
          This means the location is derived from the current location (in this case, index.html). To locate the style
          sheet from
          the current location, we must look in the assets folder, hence assets/style.css.</li>
        <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card,
          will gain
          these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
        <li>The margin property assigns 40px to the top and bottom, and the auto value to the left and right.</li>
        <li>The border property assigns a border with a width of 5px that is solid and gray.</li>
        <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects
          separated by
          commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and
          color. In our
          example, the X offset is 5px and defines the width or extent of the shadow on the X axis (or to the right of
          the box);
          the Y offset is 10px and defines the extent on the Y axis (or just below the box).</li>
        <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We
          can also
          refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #. Try selecting a color and replace the border color with
          its hex #,
          which you can find on this HTML Color Codes website (https://htmlcolorcodes.com/).</li>

      <ul>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
        <li>we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name.</li>
        <li>we use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
        <li>we've added the console.log method to the file. We can use the console.log method to output a message to the
          web console
          by adding an argument. In this case, console.log will output the value of topics to the web console because
          we've added
          it as an argument inside the parentheses.</li>
        <li>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/log</li>
        <li>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics</li>
        <li>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures</li>
        <li>When the computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition
          that we provide
          is truthy. If it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets. If the
          condition
          isn’t true or has a value that isn’t truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly
          brackets and
          move on.</li>
        <li>In JavaScript, we can have more than one condition—just like we did in the dishes pseudocode—by using else
          if, as
          demonstrated in the following code example:</li>
        <li>A for loop starts with—you guessed it—for. So far, our for loop looks like the following code:</li>
        <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements:</li>
        <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements:</li>
        <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of
          the array, we
          declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0), as shown in
          the
          following line of codSe:</li>
        <li>The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of
          the array, the
          loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array. We use the
          length
          built-in array property on our shapes array to express that condition, as shown in the following line of code:
        </li>
        <li>The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1, as shown
          in the
          following line of code:</li>
        <li>The first item in an array always starts with 0 and moves up by one.</li>
