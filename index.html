        <li>the head element contains infomration about the webpage</li>

        <li>The h1 is the opening tag and /h1 is the closing tag.</li>
        <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
        <li>the a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>* applies element to all aspects visible on a page.</li>
        <li>In the preceding statement, a
        <li>link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
        <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.
        </li>
        <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a
          relative path.
          This means the location is derived from the current location (in this case, index.html). To locate the style
          sheet from
          the current location, we must look in the assets folder, hence assets/style.css.</li>
        <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card,
          will gain
          these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
        <li>The margin property assigns 40px to the top and bottom, and the auto value to the left and right.</li>
        <li>The border property assigns a border with a width of 5px that is solid and gray.</li>
        <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects
          separated by
          commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and
          color. In our
          example, the X offset is 5px and defines the width or extent of the shadow on the X axis (or to the right of
          the box);
          the Y offset is 10px and defines the extent on the Y axis (or just below the box).</li>
        <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We
          can also
          refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #. Try selecting a color and replace the border color with
          its hex #,
          which you can find on this HTML Color Codes website (https://htmlcolorcodes.com/).</li>
